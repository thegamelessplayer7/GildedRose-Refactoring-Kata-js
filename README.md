# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This is a refactor of a code design created by Emily Bache. I refactored the code, and added an update to the system per the original Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata instructions here: https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose. 

I also wrote the accompanying unit tests to ensure that the newly refactored code still works successfully. Using the unit tests, I was able to incrementally improve the design while running the unit tests often, to ensure that my design update still allowed the code to perform within the specified paramenters.
